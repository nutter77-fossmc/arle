# `infer::http_server` — Agent Guide

OpenAI-compatible HTTP API built on `axum`. Load before touching any
HTTP-facing code — the wire format is a product contract, not an
implementation detail.

## Refactor posture

- Keep HTTP code simple and uniform. Prefer deletion-style refactors: remove
  duplicate request translation logic, collapse parallel compatibility shims,
  and keep one canonical mapping from wire format to runtime contract.

## Endpoints (what wire-format change cost looks like)

| Route | Handler | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `POST /v1/completions` | `http_server.rs` via `openai_v1::CompletionRequest` | Raw prompt. Streaming via SSE, `stream_options.include_usage` adds a final usage chunk. |
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | via `openai_v1::ChatCompletionRequest` | Uses `infer_chat::openai_messages_to_prompt` to render ChatML. |
| `POST /v1/responses` | via `openai_v1::ResponsesRequest` | Newer API surface; uses `max_output_tokens`, not `max_tokens`. |
| `GET /v1/models` | `ModelsListResponse::single(model_id, ...)` | Reads the boot-time `ServingIdentity` snapshot from `AppState`; `owned_by = "agent-infer"`. |
| `GET /v1/stats` | scheduler metrics readout | Defined on `AppState.metrics`; not part of the serving-identity snapshot. |
| Auth | optional `HttpServerConfig.api_key` | Bearer check in `http_server.rs`. |

## Invariants

1. **`RESPONSE_TIMEOUT = 300s` caps non-streaming requests only.** Streaming
   SSE has natural per-chunk flow control. Do not add a blanket timeout to
   the SSE path — long multi-turn agent runs rely on that.
2. **`session_id` is the agent-routing knob.** Accepted on every request
   type via `session_id` (primary) or `user` (alias, matches OpenAI). Empty
   string and whitespace normalize to `None` (see
   `openai_v1::normalize_session_id`). When present, the scheduler uses it
   for sticky slot routing (`docs/projects/agent-first-architecture.md::A2`).
   Never strip it silently.
3. **All three request types converge on `RequestExecutionOptions`.** Add
   new sampling / stop / session fields there once, then plumb through
   `from_completion` / `from_chat` / `from_responses`. Don't re-parse at
   the handler level.
4. **`IncomingRequest` is the scheduler's input contract** — it's built via
   `RequestExecutionOptions::into_incoming_request(prompt, delta_tx)`. The
   `delta_tx` is the backchannel the scheduler writes `CompletionStreamDelta`
   into.
5. **`CompletionStreamDelta` accumulation** — `BufferedResponse::apply_delta`
   is the single place that collects streaming chunks into a non-streaming
   response. The order matters: text_delta first, then finish_reason, then
   usage, then logprob-per-token. If you reorder, the non-streaming path
   drops data.
6. **Split the HTTP state deliberately.** `RequestHandle` remains the
   submission path; `AppState.metrics` is the stats path; `AppState.identity`
   is the boot-time serving identity snapshot (`model_id` + DFlash init
   metadata); `AppState.tokenizer` is an optional pretokenization snapshot for
   runtimes that can provide one. HTTP handlers must read served identity and
   optional tokenizer from `AppState`, not by calling back into the handle on
   every request.
7. **The handle is still `dyn RequestHandle`, not a concrete type.** The
   HTTP layer must never know whether it's talking to the CUDA scheduler
   (`SchedulerHandle`) or `BackendRuntimeHandle` (Metal/CPU). Adding a
   backend-specific path here re-creates the cfg-leak problem.
8. **`stop`, `stop_token_ids`, `ignore_eos`, `seed`** are all first-class
   sampling inputs. The match between these and `SamplingParams` is
   one-to-one via `sampling_params_from_request` — don't branch.

## Common pitfalls

- Adding a third place where stream chunks get built. There are two:
  live SSE emission in the handler, buffered accumulation in
  `BufferedResponse`. That's it.
- Using `tokio::time::timeout` around the streaming path. Streaming is
  naturally flow-controlled; a wrapping timeout causes silent cancellation.
- Emitting `logprobs` as a field on every chunk. OpenAI's protocol puts
  them in the final chunk or in non-streaming responses only; matches the
  `CompletionStreamDelta.logprob` Option semantics.

  `CompletionOutput`, `CompletionStreamDelta`, `TokenUsage`, `FinishReason`.
- `infer/src/request_handle.rs` — `RequestHandle` trait (backend-agnostic).
- `crates/chat/src/lib.rs` — chat → prompt rendering.
- `docs/projects/agent-first-architecture.md` — session routing design.
- `docs/projects/mlx-backend-roadmap.md` — Metal backend project, including
  the HTTP-side acceptance contract this AGENTS file points at.

## Distilled lessons

- **Streaming-cancel propagation from client → scheduler is a c-sweep correctness gate.** GuideLLM
  c-sweeps with stale uncancelled requests contaminate later concurrency windows; fix the
  abort-path through `delta_tx`/scheduler signaling before reading c≥4 numbers
  (`errors/2026-05-26-qwen35-hybrid-mixed-kill.md`).
- **Long-prompt serving bugs are silent against ARLE-only smoke tests** until validated against
  a PyTorch reference at matched sample size. Any HTTP-layer change touching prompt handling
  needs cross-engine validation (`wins/2026-05-22-arle-serve-long-prompt-bug-fix.md`,
  `wins/2026-05-22-arle-vs-hf-transformers-cross-validation.md`).
- **`session_id` empty string and whitespace MUST normalize to `None`** via
  `openai_v1::normalize_session_id`. Empty `session_id` strings hitting the scheduler create
  collision keys across unrelated tenants — verify both the `session_id` field AND `user`
  alias normalize through the same helper.
- **`bench validation` failure (TTFT=0, `ttft_ms=null`) reaching the scheduler is a server-block
  signal, not a GuideLLM metric bug.** Inspect server logs first
  (`errors/2026-05-25-prefill-graph-default-kill.md`).

## Performance verification

External perf measurement of this HTTP surface uses
[`scripts/bench_guidellm.sh`](../../../scripts/bench_guidellm.sh), the
canonical throughput / TTFT / ITL truth source backed by
[`vllm-project/guidellm`](https://github.com/vllm-project/guidellm). Do not
hand-roll alternative load generators when changing anything in this module;
run the wrapper and snapshot to `docs/experience/wins/`. Canonical params
and plumbing live in
[`docs/plans/guidellm-integration.md`](../../../docs/plans/guidellm-integration.md).
