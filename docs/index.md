## Canonical Truth Surfaces

| Concern | Canonical source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Support status of backends / APIs / model families / quantization | [support-matrix.md](support-matrix.md) | README and roadmap summarize only. |
| Stability levels and compatibility posture | [stability-policy.md](stability-policy.md) | Do not redefine tiers elsewhere. |
| Workspace topology and module entry points | [codebase-map.md](codebase-map.md) | Source of truth for "what exists today". |
| Architecture ownership and boundaries | [architecture.md](architecture.md) | `infer` owns runtime truth. |
| Benchmark and trace process | [bench-and-trace-spec.md](bench-and-trace-spec.md) | `guidellm` is the canonical e2e benchmark path. |
| Canonical e2e bench tool + parameter set | [plans/guidellm-integration.md](plans/guidellm-integration.md) | Wrapper script `scripts/bench_guidellm.sh` uses these params verbatim. |
| Contributor operating contract | [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) | Use with the canonical docs above. |

## Current Positioning

`ARLE` is a runtime-first Rust workspace.

- `infer` is the primary serving/runtime surface.
- `arle` is the unified local front door for agent, train, eval, and data
  workflows built on that runtime.
- Train/RL work is strategic because it strengthens the runtime loop; it does
  not create a second equal project identity.

If a plan or project note disagrees with that framing and is not explicitly
marked as the current source of truth, treat it as historical context.

## Active Projects

| [plans/2026-05-02-agent-load-bench-spec.md](plans/2026-05-02-agent-load-bench-spec.md) | Active | The question is the W3/W4 agent-load benchmark contract: short-prompt multi-turn, tool-call resume, session affinity, cache metrics, and four-engine baseline evidence. |

Read before touching `kv_tier/transport`. |
| [plans/infer-observability-v1.md](plans/infer-observability-v1.md) | Active | The question is operator-facing observability, traces, or profiling flow. |

## Historical Material

- `docs/experience/wins/` and `docs/experience/errors/` are the curated
  evidence log. The latest three of each are always-loaded per `AGENTS.md`;
  earlier entries are kept only when they are referenced from a KEEP file or
  document a milestone (M0–M5 tiered-kv, hybrid Qwen3.5 acceptance, train-
  side milestone snapshots, c1–c16 SGLang closure summary).
- `docs/experience/reviews/` is one Codex code-review snapshot retained as
  reference for the cuda-link audit.
- Plans / projects / research / reviews not listed in the active section
  above are not historical fallbacks: they were retired during the
  2026-04-25 truth-surface cleanup. Anything not on this index is not a
  source of truth.

## Truth-surface invariant

Per [`plans/2026-04-20-project-constitution-and-refactor-plan.md`](plans/2026-04-20-project-constitution-and-refactor-plan.md)
§2: every concern in the canonical-truth-surfaces table above has exactly
one definition. Adding a second one (a new index, a parallel `*/docs/`
tree, a sibling status matrix) is a regression and must be rejected at PR
time.
