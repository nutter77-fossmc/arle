# Multi-SM coverage policy

**Status:** Phase A (tier policy + env var migration) landed 2026-04-28;
Volta sm_70 legacy lane opened 2026-05-25 for V100 Qwen3.5 dense inference.
Owner: ckl. Verification: T1 four-card bench gate (sm_80/86/89/90).
Cross-link: [`tilelang-integration-verification.md`](tilelang-integration-verification.md)
for SM-specific bench thresholds, [`cuda-kernel-crate-extraction.md`](cuda-kernel-crate-extraction.md)
for the kernel-crate boundary this policy enforces.

## 1 · Why this plan exists

ARLE compiles a **single CUDA binary per host** today: `nvcc` SASS is one
SM, Triton AOT cubin is one SM (highest detected), TileLang AOT cubin is
one SM. Cross-SM cubin loading fails with `cuModuleLoadData →
CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_SOURCE` (see [`tilelang-integration-verification.md`](tilelang-integration-verification.md) §0).
Default fallback is `sm_80`, which silently accepts T3 (Volta/Turing) and
emits an unrunnable artifact.

The shipped target is one release binary that runs natively on the four
mainstream T1 SMs without rebuild, with a clear opt-in path for Blackwell
(T2). Volta V100 (`sm_70`) is a separate legacy lane: it is allowed only as an
SM-pinned build so the T1 binary never carries Volta fallback code and the
Volta binary never carries T1/Hopper-only kernels. Other pre-Ampere hardware
stays rejected.

## 2 · Tier policy

| Tier | SM | GPU 代表                           | 默认接入 | AOT 要求                                                   |
|------|----|-----------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| T1   | 80 | A100                              | yes     | every AOT kernel must emit cubin; build fails otherwise   |
| T1   | 86 | A10 / RTX 3090                    | yes     | same                                                      |
| T1   | 89 | L4 / RTX 4090                     | yes     | same                                                      |
| T1   | 90 | H100                              | yes     | same                                                      |
| T2   | 100| B100 / B200                       | no — opt-in via `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` | same as T1 once opted in |
| T2   | 120| RTX 5090 / RTX PRO 6000           | no — opt-in via `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` | same as T1 once opted in |
| T0-legacy | 70 | V100                         | auto-detect / explicit `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=7.0`; SM-pin only | Qwen3.5 BF16 attention + GDR lane for 4B/9B smoke; unsupported operators must return clear not-supported / build-time errors |
| T3   | other < 80 | T4 / Pascal / older        | rejected at build time | n/a — `panic!` with hint |

**Why T2 is opt-in.** Triton 3.6 has working evidence on sm_120 (vLLM
[PR #31089](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/31089)) but not all
12 Triton kernels have been validated. TileLang has zero upstream issues
for sm_120 in `tile-ai/tilelang`. Defaulting to T2 would make build hard
fails the common case for users on T1-only hardware.

**Why sm_70 is separate instead of T1.** V100 has useful FP16 tensor cores but
does not have native BF16 MMA, FP8, `cp.async`, TMA, WGMMA, or the shared-memory
headroom expected by the Marlin fast path. The sm_70 contract is therefore an
operator-level fallback lane:

- BF16 TileLang attention lowers through BF16→FP16 fragment conversion with
  FP32 accumulation, preserving the Qwen3.5 attention-score range contract as
  far as Volta hardware allows.
- Qwen3.5 dense BF16 KV is in scope first. The initial V100 AOT set is pinned
  to the observed 4B and 9B attention shapes: HD256 `q16_kv4` for Qwen3.5-4B
  and HD128 `q40_kv8` for Qwen3.5-9B, with HD128 `q32_kv8` kept as the adjacent
  4B/9B compatibility shape from the P0 spike. GDR TileLang kernels are enabled
  on sm_70 because Qwen3.5 smoke exercises the hybrid path. INT8 or FP8
  split-KV, DSv4, and Marlin W4/W4A8/W4+FP8 paths remain outside the initial
  V100 lane.
- The sm_70 build is SM-pinned. `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="7.0;8.9"` is rejected
  because it would either pollute T1 cubins with Volta fallbacks or pollute the
  V100 binary with kernels it cannot execute.

**Why other T3 hardware is still rejected.** T4/Turing and Pascal are not part
of the V100 target and do not share one clean fallback contract. Emitting a
binary that later segfaults on older hardware is worse than refusing to build.

**Deprecation timeline.** sm_70 support is legacy and tied to available V100
validation capacity. Keep it while Qwen3.5-4B / Qwen3.5-9B dense inference can
hit the V100 gate in this plan. Revisit every quarter; remove only after either
(a) the V100 validation host is retired and no production/customer workflow
depends on it, or (b) the fallback path falls below the documented performance
floor for two consecutive validation cycles and no owner accepts the repair.

## 3 · Environment variable contract

ARLE uses the **PyTorch / vLLM / SGLang / FlashInfer standard env var**
[`TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/cpp_extension.html).
`CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` is accepted as alias.

The legacy `INFER_CUDA_SM` / `CUDA_SM` were removed in this rollout. No
backwards-compat shim — see `feedback_no_half_states.md`.

**Resolution order** (`crates/cuda-kernels/build.rs::detect_sm_targets`):

1. `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` — semicolon / comma / space separated, PyTorch format
2. `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` — same parser
3. `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=compute_cap` — auto-detect the local GPU
4. Default to **T1 set** `{80, 86, 89, 90}` — never includes T2 or sm_70

**Accepted formats** (any combination per-token):

| Form              | Example          | Source convention |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Major.minor       | `8.0`            | PyTorch native    |
| Packed integer    | `80`             | CMake / nvcc      |
| nvcc style        | `sm_80`          | NVCC `-arch=`     |
| nvcc PTX style    | `compute_80`     | NVCC `-arch=`     |
| `+PTX` suffix     | `9.0+PTX`        | PyTorch native    |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Default (no env): T1 fat binary
cargo build --release --features cuda

# Explicit T1 only (CI default)
TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="8.0;8.6;8.9;9.0" cargo build --release --features cuda

# T1 + B100 (datacenter Blackwell)
TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="8.0;8.6;8.9;9.0;10.0" cargo build --release --features cuda

# RTX 5090-only build (Blackwell consumer)
TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="12.0" cargo build --release --features cuda

# V100-only legacy build (SM-pinned, Qwen3.5 dense lane)
TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="7.0" cargo build --release --features cuda

# CMake-style integer alias works too
CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="80;86;89;90" cargo build --release --features cuda

# Force PTX for forward compat to unknown hardware
TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="9.0+PTX" cargo build --release --features cuda
```

**Difference from PyTorch.** PyTorch is *best-effort* — if a kernel can't
compile for a target SM, it warns and skips. ARLE is **hard-fail**: any
target SM that can't emit cubin for any kernel panics the build, with a
suggested `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` value to exclude that SM. This matches
the production-binary contract: every supported SM must work.

The sm_70 exception is not a warn-skip path. Unsupported operator families
produce compiled not-supported wrappers or build-time hard rejects with this
document as the rationale; Qwen3.5 dense attention kernels still hard-fail if
their sm_70 cubin cannot be emitted.

---

## 4 · AOT failure policy

When Triton AOT or TileLang AOT can't emit cubin for an opt-in SM:

1. `build.rs` panics immediately with the failing (SM, kernel) tuple.
2. Error message includes a suggested `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=...` excluding
   that SM, plus a pointer to upstream version requirements
   (`requirements-build.txt::triton`, `pyproject.toml::tilelang`).
3. User options:
   - Bump the upstream toolchain (commit the bump, re-run).
   - Exclude the SM from `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` and accept reduced coverage.
   - File an upstream issue (the canonical Blackwell scoreboard sit at
     [Triton issue #5950](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/issues/5950)
     and [tile-ai/tilelang issues](https://github.com/tile-ai/tilelang/issues)).

There is no warn-skip path. A binary that silently lacks cubin for a
declared target SM is a footgun.

## 5 · Bench gate (commit D ship criteria)

Before declaring multi-SM "done" and removing the `pending-remote` stubs:

| GPU                  | SM | Test                                       | Bench                                         |
|----------------------|----|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| A100 (40/80 GB)      | 80 | `cargo test --release --test e2e`           | `scripts/bench_guidellm.sh cuda-multi-sm-80`  |
| A10 or RTX 3090      | 86 | `cargo test --release --test e2e`           | `scripts/bench_guidellm.sh cuda-multi-sm-86`  |
| L4 or RTX 4090       | 89 | `cargo test --release --test e2e_qwen35`    | `scripts/bench_guidellm.sh cuda-multi-sm-89`  |
| H100                 | 90 | `cargo test --release --test e2e_qwen35`    | `scripts/bench_guidellm.sh cuda-multi-sm-90`  |

**Pass criteria:**
- e2e tests green on all four cards.
- `bench_guidellm.sh` TTFT and out_tok/s within **±5 %** of the most recent
  same-SM baseline in `docs/experience/wins/` (sm_89 baseline already exists
  via `2026-04-27-bench-guidellm-cuda-l4-qwen35-0p8b-packed-gguf.md`; sm_90
  baseline from the TileLang Phase-0 H100 run; sm_80 / sm_86 baselines TBD,
  the first bench *is* the baseline).

**Fail recovery:**
- Per-SM regression > 5 % → record in `docs/experience/errors/` with root
  cause; do not ship the multi-SM binary on that SM until resolved.
- The other three SMs can ship independently if their wins/ entries land
  cleanly.

## 6 · Implementation phases

| Commit | Scope | Local verify | Remote verify |
|--------|-------|--------------|---------------|
| **A** | Tier policy + `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` parsing + delete `INFER_CUDA_SM` + docs + bench stubs | Mac `cargo check --features cuda,no-cuda` | none |
| **B** | Triton AOT multi-cubin + dispatch wrapper for 12 kernels | none | Linux + nvcc + ≥1 T1 GPU |
| **C** | TileLang AOT multi-cubin + dispatch wrapper for 3 head families | none | Linux + nvcc + ≥1 T1 GPU |
| **D** | T1 four-card bench validation; replace `pending-remote` stubs | none | A100 + A10/3090 + L4 + H100 |

Commits B and C are independent (no order dependency); both require
Commit A's tier policy to be in place.
