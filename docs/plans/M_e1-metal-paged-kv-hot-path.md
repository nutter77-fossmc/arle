## 0. Goal

Replace the contiguous `[B, n_kv_heads, S, head_dim]` per-request cache
under `Qwen35PackedDecodeBatch` (left-padding + additive mask + per-row
RoPE offsets per `infer/src/backend/metal/AGENTS.md` invariant 7) with
token-slot KV writes into `MetalKVPool` plus `gather_kv_rows` at
attention time. This eliminates left-padding overhead at c≥4 and is
the only known route to closing the 3× output-tok/s gap vs mlx-lm on
M-series.

## 1. Substrate already in tree

`infer/src/backend/metal/kv_pool.rs` — fully built but unused on the
hot path:

- `MetalKVPool::new(num_layers, num_kv_heads, head_dim, max_total_tokens, dtype)`
- `alloc_tokens`, `alloc_slots`, `share_slots`, `share_prefix_from`
- `write_kv(layer, request_id, k, v)`, `write_kv_slots(layer, slots, k, v)`
- `gather_kv(layer, request_id) -> (MlxArray, MlxArray)`
- `gather_kv_rows(layer, requests) -> (MlxArray, MlxArray)`
- `release_slots`, `select_eviction_candidates`, `reclaim_target_tokens`

Only call site in production: `runtime.rs:2863` reads `kv_pool_usage()`
for the pressure-metric report (the M2 KvTierAdapter pressure feed).
Zero KV writes / reads pass through the pool today.

## 2. Why mlx-lm wins at c=16

mlx-lm decode does NOT left-pad. Each request has its own KV cache
maintained via slice-append on a per-row buffer; attention compute
reads each request's K/V as a slice. The packed batch is built only
at the SDPA step, with no padding because each query has exactly
`current_seq_len` keys.

ARLE's `Qwen35PackedDecodeBatch` left-pads the entire batch to the
longest in-flight prompt. With variable-length prompts this wastes
compute proportional to length variance. At c=4 the variance fits in
one tick's compute envelope; at c=16 the wasted compute dominates.

## 3. Atomic commit sequence

Each commit lands a bench entry per CLAUDE.md §Benchmarks. The cap
default of 4 stays until commit 5 lands.

### Commit 1 — wire `MetalKVPool::new` into the runtime startup

- Allocate one `MetalKVPool` per active scheduler runtime, sized by
  `MetalSchedulerConfig::max_running_requests * METAL_PREFIX_BLOCK_SIZE
  * <max_seq_len>` (with a sensible cap).
- Plumb dtype from the loaded weights (Qwen3.5 quant currently means
  the K/V activation dtype is BF16 or F16).
- No behavior change. The pool is allocated, the pressure-metric path
  feeds from it, but writes continue through the legacy concat path.
- Effort: **S**. Touches: `metal/runtime.rs`.
- Bench: regression-only — confirm c=4 baseline at ITL 19 ms median.

### Commit 2 — slot allocation lifecycle on prefill

- On prefill admit: allocate slots equal to prompt length via
  `pool.alloc_tokens(request_id, prompt_len)`.
- On request finish: `pool.free_request(request_id)`.
- Read the slot indices from the request state but do NOT yet write
  K/V into them — concat path still owns numerics.
- Effort: **S**. Touches: `metal/request_state.rs`, `metal/runtime.rs`.
- Bench: regression-only — confirm allocation overhead is sub-1 ms
  per prefill (bench c=4 baseline still at ~19 ms ITL).

### Commit 3 — dual-write K/V (concat + pool) under `--metal-kv-pool`

- Behind the existing `--kv-pool` flag (currently a no-op for Qwen3.5):
  on each decode step, write the new K/V vectors to BOTH the legacy
  concat cache AND the pool via `pool.write_kv_slots(layer, slots, k, v)`.
- Attention still reads from concat (legacy correctness).
- Property test: the gathered K/V via `pool.gather_kv` matches the
  concat cache slice for the same request.
- Effort: **M**. Touches: `metal/qwen35.rs`, `metal/request_state.rs`.
- Bench: confirm dual-write does NOT regress ITL beyond 1 ms (bench
  with `--max-running-requests 4 --kv-pool` and without).

### Commit 4 — kernel switches read path to `gather_kv_rows`

- Under `--kv-pool`: SDPA input K/V comes from `gather_kv_rows(layer,
  request_ids)` instead of the concat cache.
- The gather path produces tensors of exact length per request — no
  left-pad. Attention mask and RoPE offsets become per-request scalars
  again (not per-row arrays).
- Concat path stays as the `--kv-pool=false` fallback for one release.
- Effort: **L**. Touches: `metal/qwen35.rs`, `metal/runtime.rs`,
  possibly `crates/mlx-sys/src/mlx_qwen35_model.cpp`.
- Bench acceptance — **tightened 2026-05-07** per c=1 isolation
  decomposition
  ([`2026-05-07-bench-guidellm-metal-c1-isolation-decomposition.md`](../experience/wins/2026-05-07-bench-guidellm-metal-c1-isolation-decomposition.md)):
  the c=4 long-context ITL gap algebraically decomposes into 1.29×
  per-token kernel × 2.09× ARLE-specific batching multiplier; this
  commit kills the 2.09× factor. Targets:
  - **c=4 ITL p50 ≤ 9.3 ms** (was 19.34 ms; target = ARLE c=1 long
    ITL of 4.37 ms × mlx-lm-style 2.12 batching multiplier).
  - **c=16 ITL p50 ≤ 12 ms** (was 82.49 ms; target = ARLE c=1 long
    ITL × extrapolated mlx-lm ~2.7 multiplier).
  - **c=16 output tok/s ≥ 350** (was 78; target ≥ 75% of mlx-lm
    c=16's 467 tok/s).
  - c=1 baseline must NOT regress: ITL p50 stays within 1.05× of
    today's 4.37 ms (paged-KV write/read overhead must be sub-5%
    on single-stream).
  - Original conservative numbers (35 ms / 300 tok/s) baked in the
    wrong "2.7× per-token kernel" assumption that the morning's
    apples-to-apples wins entry surfaced and the c=1 isolation
    entry refuted.

### Commit 5 — flip default `max_running_requests` from 4 to 16

- After commit 4 lands and the bench shows scaling reverses to
  monotonic, change `MetalSchedulerConfig::default().max_running_requests`
  from 4 to 16.
- The new flag (commit landed bbc484c) lets operators tune both
  directions; the default was empirically calibrated at c=4 only
  because of the left-pad collapse.
- Effort: **S**. Touches: `metal/scheduler.rs`.
- Bench: full c-sweep + matched-A/B vs mlx-lm at c=16; expect parity
  on output tok/s, ARLE wins on ITL p95 stability per the morning's
  evidence.

### Commit 6 — retire the concat path

- Once commit 5 has shipped one bench window without rollback, drop
  the legacy concat KV cache code path from `Qwen35PackedDecodeBatch`
  entirely. Reduces hot-path branches and `request_state.rs` size.
- Effort: **S**. Touches: `metal/request_state.rs`, `metal/qwen35.rs`,
  `metal/runtime.rs`.
- Bench: no expected delta; pure deletion-style refactor per
  `feedback_no_half_states.md` ("finish a refactor unit fully").

## 4. Acceptance gates (whole plan)

- `cargo test -p infer --lib` continues at 556+ passing post-each-
  commit (no scheduler regressions).
- `--fast` bench `metal-m-paged-kv-c16` after commit 4 vs the recorded
  c-sweep baseline (numbers tightened 2026-05-07 evening per c=1
  isolation decomposition):
  - output tok/s c=16 ≥ **350** (was 78; ≥ 75% of mlx-lm c=16 467)
  - ITL p50 c=16 ≤ **12 ms** (was 82.49 ms)
  - ITL p95 c=16 ≤ **15 ms** (was 84 ms)
  - peer with mlx-lm c=16 within ±25% on output tok/s
- c=1 isolation regression gate (matched-A/B against pre-commit
  baseline): c=1 long-context ITL p50 stays ≤ 1.05× of pre-commit
  4.37 ms — paged-KV write/read overhead must not show up on
  single-stream.
- `cargo check -p infer --no-default-features --features cuda,no-cuda`
  remains green throughout (CUDA-Rust drift gate; no CUDA hot-path
  changes are introduced by this plan).
- ELI Layer-1 smoke (curl /v1/chat/completions with tool_choice +
  response_format) returns HTTP 200 with valid completion after each
  commit; the request shape contract is unchanged.

## 5. Out of scope

- **Full vLLM-style block-table-indirect-attention.** The token-slot
  pool stops short of letting the attention kernel itself walk a
  block table; it materializes contiguous K/V via `gather_kv_rows`
  before SDPA. This is enough to close the left-pad gap; true
  block-table-aware attention is M_e.2.
- **KV quantization.** Q8 / FP8 KV is Tier A#2 and lives on the
  shared `infer/src/ops/kv_ops.rs` per the M4 unification frame
  ([`strategy doc`](../projects/2026-05-07-metal-world-first-strategy.md)).
  It composes orthogonally on top
  of this plan.
- **Multi-LoRA.** Punica/S-LoRA on Metal is Tier D frontier work, no
  upstream baseline to compete with — separate plan.
- **CUDA path.** Out of scope per user directive ("metal 自主迭代",
  "不影响 cuda 的性能"). CUDA already has paged-KV via
  `cuda_kernels::PagedKVPool`; this plan is the Metal sibling, not a
  unification.

## 7. Errata — 2026-05-07 (post-audit, same day)

A second audit pass after this plan was first committed surfaced two
substrate-state errors that re-shape commits 1–3. The corrected
picture is below; commits 4–6 (the actual unlock + cleanup) still
hold.

### 7.1 What §1 got wrong

§1 claimed `MetalKVPool` is "fully built but unused on the hot path"
based on a `grep MetalKVPool` of `infer/src/backend/metal/` that
**missed `request_state.rs`**, where the pool actually IS wired. The
correct picture:

- `Qwen3StepDriver` (`request_state.rs:3270-3290`) carries
  `kv_pool: Option<MetalKVPool>`; populated when `use_kv_pool=true`
  (currently driven by the experimental `--kv-pool` flag for the
  Qwen3 fallback path per `metal_serve --help`).
- `decode_qwen3_batch` (`request_state.rs:1787-1856`) ALREADY routes
  per-step K/V through `pool.write_kv` + `pool.gather_kv` when the
  pool is present; otherwise falls back to slice-style accumulation.
- Production default keeps `kv_pool=None` — the pool path exists but
  is opt-in per `--kv-pool` flag and Qwen3-only.

**§1 of this plan is therefore wrong about the substrate state.** The
substrate is partially live; the gap is not "wire it up at all" but
"promote it to the right scope and reach Qwen3.5".

### 7.2 What §3 got wrong

The runtime-level pool allocation (commit 1) and slot-lifecycle plumbing
(commit 2) were both written assuming greenfield. They aren't:

- **Per-request, not runtime-shared.** `Qwen3StepDriver` constructs
  its OWN `MetalKVPool::new(...)` (`request_state.rs:3358-3371`).
  Different drivers don't share the pool — each request pre-allocates
  its private slot range, and writes use the singleton key
  `METAL_REQUEST_STATE_ID` (line 1790). This is functionally a
  per-request linear cache that avoids `concat`-style realloc; it is
  NOT cross-request paged attention.
- **`MetalKVPool` API is ALREADY cross-request capable.** Methods
  take `request_id: usize` as the slot owner. The current per-driver
  pattern just doesn't use the dimension.
- **Qwen3.5 packed decode is the actual left-pad source.** The hot
  path that benches at 82 ms ITL@c=16 is `Qwen35PackedDecodeBatch`
  (a different code path inside `request_state.rs` and `qwen35.rs`),
  not `decode_qwen3_batch`.

### 7.3 Corrected commit sequence

Commits 4 and 5 stay as written. Commits 1–3 are reshaped:

- **Commit 1 (revised) — promote `MetalKVPool` from per-driver to
  runtime-shared.** Move ownership from `Qwen3StepDriver` to the
  scheduler runtime; each driver borrows the shared pool. Each
  request gets a real unique `request_id` instead of the singleton
  `METAL_REQUEST_STATE_ID`. Behavior under `--kv-pool` continues to
  match Qwen3 today (just with shared backing). Effort: M (was S).
- **Commit 2 (revised) — slot-lifecycle hooks at scheduler admit /
  finish.** Same intent as before, but reading from a shared pool
  using the unique request_id from commit 1. Effort: S (unchanged).
- **Commit 3 (revised) — Qwen3.5 packed decode dual-write under a
  new `--kv-pool=qwen35` mode.** This is the real new slice. Make
  `Qwen35PackedDecodeBatch` write per-step K/V to the shared pool in
  parallel with the legacy left-pad concat, with a property test
  that gathered values match the concat slice. Effort: M (was M; same
  effort, different file).
- **Commits 4–6 unchanged.** The `gather_kv_rows`-as-attention-input
  cutover (commit 4), the default flip (commit 5), and the legacy-
  path retirement (commit 6) all still apply. The acceptance numbers
  in §3 (output tok/s c=16 ≥ 300, ITL p95 c=16 ≤ 35 ms) still hold.

### 7.4 Second errata — CPP session owns K/V opaquely

A third audit pass during P2.1 implementation surfaced another
substrate constraint that further reshapes the plan. After P2.0
landed (`e25d617` — `Qwen35StepDriver` allocates the pool when
`--kv-pool` is on), reading the C++ step path revealed:

- `Qwen35StepMode::Cpp(Qwen35CppState)` owns `kv_flat: Vec<MlxArray>`
  which is the K/V cache storage.
- `Qwen35CppState::ensure_session_active` (`request_state.rs:3699`)
  calls `cpp_model.begin_session(&self.kv_flat, &self.gdr_flat)`
  THEN immediately `self.kv_flat.clear()`. **The Rust side has
  no access to K/V data while the C++ session is active.**
- K/V data only returns to Rust at `end_session(...)` boundaries
  (between requests / between distinct decode passes), not per
  step.
- The smoke log line in P2.0
  ("`C++ forward model ready (all 24 layers wired through one step
  call; gdr_kernel=metal)`") confirms the production hot path runs
  in CPP mode.

So **P2.1 as conceived (per-step dual-write in `Qwen35StepDriver`) is
structurally impossible without C++ bridge changes.** The pool can be
allocated (P2.0 ✓) but cannot be written from Rust during a CPP
session because the K/V doesn't live there.

### 7.5 Re-scoped commit sequence for Qwen3.5 CPP path

The plan now requires C++ bridge work before any pool integration on
the production hot path. The new sequence:

- **P2.1 (re-scoped) — C++ session per-step KV readback API.**
  Add a `cpp_model.read_step_kv(layer, dst_buffer)` (or similar) FFI
  to `crates/mlx-sys/src/mlx_qwen35_model.cpp` that copies the latest
  appended K/V row out of the session's internal cache into a
  Rust-side MlxArray. Used in P2.2 to feed the pool. Effort: M.
  Files: `crates/mlx-sys/src/mlx_qwen35_model.cpp` + the C-API
  surface; no Rust hot-path change.
- **P2.2 — Qwen3.5 dual-write under flag.** With the new readback,
  per-step: call `read_step_kv` per layer, write to pool via
  `pool.write_kv_slots`. Property test: `pool.gather_kv(layer, req_id)`
  matches the readback bytes. Effort: M.
- **P3.1 (unchanged in shape, larger in C++ scope) — kernel cutover.**
  Now requires C++ to read K/V from the pool slots and feed SDPA in
  place of the session-internal KV. This is the real paged-attention
  rewrite on the C++ side. Effort: L.
- **Alternative path** if C++ readback is too invasive: switch
  Qwen3.5 to `Qwen35StepMode::Rust` for the production hot path,
  giving Rust direct access to `state.k_caches/v_caches`. This
  trades C++ optimizations (compiled session, fused step) for
  Rust-side dual-write feasibility. Likely worse perf in P2.x,
  better at P3.x. Decision deferred until C++ readback effort is
  estimated.

P4.1 / P4.2 (default flip + concat retire) and P5.1 (per-token
profile) are unaffected. Acceptance numbers in §3 / §4 unchanged.

### 7.6 Lesson for future audits

`grep <Type>` against a single subtree is insufficient for "is this
type wired?" questions. The audit should grep across `infer/src/` and
all `crates/` for the type, AND grep for any singleton/magic constants
that might indicate scoped-but-not-shared usage (e.g.
`METAL_REQUEST_STATE_ID` here). Logged as a lesson under the next
session's feedback memory if the pattern recurs.

The §7.4 finding adds a second class of audit pitfall: when a hot
path crosses an FFI boundary, **read the FFI ownership transfer
points** (begin/end session, alloc/free, take/return). Cached
substrate (`kv_flat: Vec<MlxArray>`) can be present in Rust but
*emptied* during sessions — the field exists but the data lives on
the other side of the bridge. Logged as a separate feedback memory
in this session.
