# TileLang integration — Phase 0: prefill HD128 attention

**Status:** Phase 0 **shipped as default 2026-04-28**. The `cuda` feature
now implies `tilelang-attn` (see `crates/cuda-kernels/Cargo.toml`); every
`--features cuda` build uses the TileLang prefill HD128 kernel. The
matched A/B that motivated the promotion is at
`docs/experience/wins/2026-04-28-bench-guidellm-cuda-l4-tilelang-prefill-causal-bound.md`
(historical reference, file removed):
TTFT p50 -82%, out tok/s +5.1% vs FlashInfer at c=16/4096-in/Qwen3-4B/L4
after Patches A (causal-bound KV loop) + C (page-lookup hoist) landed.

Owner: ckl. Verification: L4 sm_89 (in-tree). Prior art:
`docs/plans/cuda-kernel-crate-extraction.md` (blueprint style),
`crates/cuda-kernels/build.rs` lines 195–263 + 265–510 (Triton AOT
pattern this plan mirrored).

## 1 · Why this plan exists

We want to evaluate whether a [TileLang][tilelang] kernel can beat the
current FlashInfer batch prefill HD128 path end-to-end. The decision rule
the user laid down is: **don't migrate small kernels — only kernels whose
end-to-end delta is large enough to justify the swap, and only by replacing
a complete sub-graph, not a fragment**.

Phase 0 picks the smallest sub-graph that is (a) on the hot path of
`bench_guidellm.sh` TTFT/throughput and (b) cleanly bounded by an existing
FFI seam. That is the **batch prefill HD128 attention compute** — the
`flashinfer_batch_prefill_paged_hd128_plan` + `_run` pair. Everything around
it (prep kernel, projections, decode path, HD256) stays untouched.

**Verification path:** user runs `scripts/bench_guidellm.sh
tilelang-prefill-{on,off}` on remote H100 + `cargo test --features
cuda,tilelang-attn --test e2e` for numerical parity. Local Mac workspace
verifies type-check (`cargo check -p infer --no-default-features --features
cuda,no-cuda`) and Triton-style build wiring; CUDA runtime + bench are
remote-only.

## 2 · Sub-graph contract (precise boundary)

Replace both halves of the FlashInfer paged prefill HD128 path under
`feature = "tilelang-attn"`:

- The per-forward `plan.plan_hd128(...)` call in
  `PagedPrefillForward::new_hd128` (`infer/src/ops/attention.rs`) — TileLang
  reads paged KV directly and never consumes the FlashInfer plan_info, so
  paying for the plan would taint the A/B comparison.
- The per-layer `flashinfer_batch_prefill_paged_hd128_run` FFI call in
  `prefill_attention_paged_batch` (same file).

Keep untouched:

- `prefill_attention_paged_prep_cuda` (RMS norm + RoPE + KV write to paged
  pool) — data-path, orthogonal to attention compute.
- HD256 prefill — Qwen3.5 full-attn parity, out of scope.
- Decode HD128/HD256 — out of scope (Phase 1 if Phase 0 wins).
- All projections, residual, MLP, norms outside the prep kernel.

**Contract for each TileLang kernel** (BF16 throughout, causal mask, no soft-cap):

```text
Inputs (device pointers):
  q          : [packed_tokens, num_q_heads * 128]   already RMS-normed + RoPE'd
  k_pool     : paged K storage, HND layout, page_size = 16
  v_pool     : paged V storage, HND layout, page_size = 16
  q_indptr   : [batch_size + 1]   packed-token offsets per request
  kv_indptr  : [batch_size + 1]   paged-KV page-index offsets per request
  kv_indices : flattened page indices for all sequences in the batch
  kv_last_page_len : [batch_size]
Outputs:
  o          : [packed_tokens, num_q_heads * 128]
Compile-time invariants (one cubin per (num_q_heads, num_kv_heads) pair):
  head_dim   = 128
  page_size  = 16
  sm_scale   = 1.0 / sqrt(128)
Runtime scalars:
  batch_size, total_q_tokens, max_qlen,
  num_q_heads, num_kv_heads (passed for symmetry; redundant with the cubin's
  baked constants but kept in the FFI signature so the C wrapper can
  validate-and-launch without indirection).
```

The cubin set is AOT-specialized at build time over the Qwen3 HD128 family:
`(16,8)` 0.6B/1.7B, `(32,8)` 4B/8B, `(40,8)` 14B, `(64,8)` 32B.  Rust
dispatches by `(num_q_heads, num_kv_heads)`; an unsupported pair returns an
`anyhow!` error pointing at the three lockstep lists to extend
(`SUPPORTED_HEADS` in the Python kernel module,
`TILELANG_PREFILL_HD128_HEAD_CONFIGS` in `cuda-kernels/build.rs`, and the
FFI macro arms in `cuda-kernels/src/ffi/attention.rs`).

---

## 3 · Build-time AOT pattern (mirror Triton)

The project already runs Python-driven AOT compilation for Triton kernels in
`crates/cuda-kernels/build.rs`. Phase 0 adds a parallel TileLang track that
follows the same shape:

| Step | Triton (existing) | TileLang (new) |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| Find Python | `find_triton_python()` (env `INFER_TRITON_PYTHON`, then `.venv`s, then `python3`/`python`) | `find_tilelang_python()` (env `INFER_TILELANG_PYTHON`, same fallback chain, probes `import tilelang`) |
| AOT script | `tools/triton/gen_triton_aot.py` | `tools/tilelang/gen_tilelang_aot.py` |
| Per-kernel spec | `TritonKernelSpec` (kernel_path, name, signature, grid, num_warps, num_stages) | `TileLangKernelSpec` (kernel_path, name, target SM, output dir) |
| Output | CUBIN + generated C wrapper → linked into `libcuda-kernels.a` | Same: CUBIN + generated C wrapper → linked in |
| Runtime | C function pointer; no Python | Same |
| Feature gate | always on under `feature = "cuda"` | only under `feature = "tilelang-attn"` (which itself implies `cuda`) |

Why this pattern:

- Production runtime contains no Python — matches ARLE's existing posture.
- Reuses existing `cargo:rerun-if-changed` plumbing for `tools/`.
- Keeps `cargo build --features cuda` (default) byte-identical to today —
  TileLang work is purely additive behind its feature flag.

`@tilelang.jit` JIT-and-cache was considered and rejected (Option B in the
2026-04-26 design discussion) because it pulls Python into the prod path
and breaks parity with how Triton is wired today.

## 4 · File-level changes

### 4.1 New files

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `crates/cuda-kernels/tools/tilelang/__init__.py` | Package marker. |
| `crates/cuda-kernels/tools/tilelang/gen_tilelang_aot.py` | AOT compile script. Inputs: kernel module path, kernel function name, target SM, output dir. Outputs: CUBIN + generated C wrapper. Prints `FUNC_NAME=…` and `C_PATH=…` on stdout (mirrors Triton). |
| `crates/cuda-kernels/tools/tilelang/batch_prefill_paged_hd128.py` | TileLang kernel definition for the contract in §2. |
| `crates/cuda-kernels/tools/tilelang/README.md` | Bootstrap notes: `pip install tilelang`, `INFER_TILELANG_PYTHON`, expected versions. |
| `docs/plans/tilelang-integration.md` | This document. |
| `docs/experience/wins/2026-04-26-bench-guidellm-cuda-tilelang-prefill-hd128-pending-remote.md` | Bench stub (pending-remote per §Benchmarks rules in AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md). |

The AOT-generated C wrapper lands under `OUT_DIR/tilelang_aot/<artifact>/`,
not in the source tree. No hand-written `.cu` wrapper is added.

### 4.2 Modified files

| Path | Change |
|------|--------|
| `Cargo.toml` (workspace root) | Add `tilelang-attn = ["cuda", "cli/tilelang-attn"]` so `cargo build --features tilelang-attn` implies the CUDA backend instead of producing a binary without a selected backend. |
| `crates/cli/Cargo.toml` | Add `tilelang-attn = ["cuda", "infer/tilelang-attn"]` to forward through the CLI crate and keep the CLI backend enabled. |
| `infer/Cargo.toml` | Add `tilelang-attn = ["cuda", "cuda-kernels/tilelang-attn"]`. |
| `crates/cuda-kernels/Cargo.toml` | Add `tilelang-attn = ["cuda"]`. |
| `crates/cuda-kernels/build.rs` | Behind `cfg(feature = "tilelang-attn")`: probe Python with `import tilelang`, loop over `TILELANG_PREFILL_HD128_HEAD_CONFIGS` running the AOT generator once per `(num_q_heads, num_kv_heads)` pair, compile all generated C wrappers into a single `libtilelang_kernels_aot.a`. Mirrors the existing Triton track. |
| `crates/cuda-kernels/src/ffi/attention.rs` | Declare one `tilelang_batch_prefill_paged_hd128_q{Q}_kv{KV}_run_cuda` extern per supported head config via a small `macro_rules!`. Single shared parameter list. |
| `infer/src/ops/attention.rs` | (a) Keep `BatchPrefillPagedPlan` out of the TileLang signature so TileLang builds upload only shared indptr/last-page-len metadata and allocate no FlashInfer plan/workspace on this path. (b) At the per-layer dispatch site, match on `(num_q_heads, num_kv_heads)` to pick the matching FFI symbol; unsupported pairs return an `anyhow!` error pointing at the lockstep lists. **Compile-time only** — one canonical path per build (`feedback_no_half_states.md`). |
| `infer/src/model/qwen3/prefill.rs` | Cfg-gate the FlashInfer prefill plan storage and calls so Qwen3 TileLang prefill does not construct a `BatchPrefillPagedPlan`. |
| `scripts/start_infer.sh` | Honor `INFER_FEATURES` env var (default `cuda`) so the bench wrapper can launch a TileLang-on server without editing the script. |
| `pyproject.toml` | Add `[project.optional-dependencies] tilelang = ["tilelang>=…"]`. Pin in §6 once the H100 spike picks a version. |

### 4.3 Deliberately NOT changed

- HD256 prefill, decode HD128/HD256, prep kernel, scheduler, any `.cu`
  source, any Triton kernel, any test data baseline.
- No changes to `crates/cuda-kernels/src/prelude.rs` — the new FFI is not a
  proto-public symbol, it's an internal alternate path.

---

## 5 · Risk gates and stop conditions

This plan is fail-fast. Stop conditions, in order:

1. **TileLang cannot AOT-export the kernel for `sm_90`.** The AOT generator
   panics in `build.rs`, no FFI is wired yet. Outcome: write
   `docs/experience/errors/2026-04-…-tilelang-aot-sm90-blocker.md`,
   delete the new files, revert. Phase 0 closed; user decides whether to
   reopen as Option B (runtime JIT).
2. **TileLang lacks paged-KV BatchPrefill primitives at the API level.** If
   the `tools/tilelang/batch_prefill_paged_hd128.py` cannot express the
   §2 contract without forking TileLang, stop and write the same
   blocker entry.
3. **Numerical parity failure on H100.** `cargo test --features
   cuda,tilelang-attn --test e2e` fails the `infer/test_data/Qwen3-4B.json`
   substring match. Outcome: errors entry, revert.
4. **Performance regression on H100 bench.** TileLang TTFT or out-tok/s is
   ≥5% worse than FlashInfer at any sweep step. Outcome: errors entry,
   feature flag stays in tree off-by-default but Phase 1 does not start.
5. **Performance flat (within ±5%).** Outcome: wins entry documenting flat,
   feature flag stays in tree off-by-default, Phase 1 does not start.
6. **Performance win ≥10% on TTFT or saturation throughput.** Outcome:
   wins entry, Phase 1 (decode HD128/HD256 migration) begins; feature
   flag eventually retired in favor of TileLang as the only path.

The 5–10% band is intentionally a no-go zone — too small to justify the
runtime complexity of carrying two attention paths long-term per the
"clean and uniform" principle in AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md.

---

## 6 · Open questions (resolved during spike, not before)

- **TileLang version pin.** Picked by the AOT generator's first successful
  run on H100. Documented in the wins entry.
- **CUTLASS / CuTeDSL backend selection.** TileLang's CuTeDSL backend
  (per the upstream README) gives the best Hopper utilization. The Python
  kernel will request it explicitly; if unavailable in the pinned version,
  fall back to the default backend and note it.
- **`num_warps` / pipeline stages.** Tuned during spike; logged in the
  bench entry. Not a contract change.

---

## 7 · Acceptance checklist

Phase 0 is "done" only when **all** of these are true:

- [ ] `cargo build --release --features cuda` produces a binary identical
  in behavior to pre-Phase-0 (no functional change to default build).
- [ ] `cargo build --release --features cuda,tilelang-attn` builds on the
  H100 host.
- [ ] `cargo check -p infer --no-default-features --features cuda,no-cuda`
  passes on macOS (type-check guard).
- [ ] `cargo test --release --features cuda,tilelang-attn --test e2e`
  passes on H100 (numerical parity vs `infer/test_data/Qwen3-4B.json`).
- [ ] `scripts/bench_guidellm.sh tilelang-prefill-on` and
  `…-prefill-off` both ran on H100; deltas captured in the wins entry.
- [ ] Decision recorded per §5: ship to Phase 1, hold flat, or revert.
- [ ] No half-states left in tree (`feedback_no_half_states.md`): either
  the feature is in and gated, or the new files are gone. Never both.

---

## 8 · Phase 1 preview (informational only)

If Phase 0 wins ≥10%: Phase 1 migrates decode HD128 + HD256 to TileLang
under the same feature flag, then retires the flag and removes the
FlashInfer attention dependency from the prefill+decode hot path. HD256
prefill (Qwen3.5 full-attn) follows after decode is stable. MLA (DeepSeek
path, currently roadmapped) becomes a Phase 2 target with separate plan
doc — TileLang's MLA primitives are the strongest case in the upstream
project and warrant their own evaluation.

### Tranche ledger (full-integration / "全部接入" series)

- **Tranche 4 (TC decode alias) — landed 2026-04-27.** Aliases the Qwen3
  BF16 batched-decode hot path (FlashInfer `flashinfer_tc_decode_run`)
  onto the existing Phase 0 TileLang prefill HD128 cubin family; pure
  Rust dispatch swap, no new kernel, no `.cu` changes. Default builds
  remain on FlashInfer; `--features tilelang-attn` enables the alias.
  Pending-remote bench stub:
  `docs/experience/wins/2026-04-27-bench-guidellm-cuda-tilelang-tc-decode-hd128-pending-remote.md`
  (historical reference, file removed).

- **Tranche 2 (HD256 paged-prefill swap) — landed 2026-04-27.** Wires
  the new TileLang HD256 paged-prefill kernel
  (`crates/cuda-kernels/tools/tilelang/batch_prefill_paged_hd256.py`,
  authored upstream of this tranche) into build.rs / FFI / Rust dispatch
  under the same `tilelang-attn` flag. AOT-specialized over the Qwen3.5
  full-attn head configs `(8,2)`, `(16,2)`, `(16,4)` (covers 0.8B, MoE
  30B-A3B, medium / 14B / 32B-class). Default builds remain on FlashInfer
  `flashinfer_batch_prefill_paged_hd256_run`; `--features tilelang-attn`
  swaps in the TileLang path. The four Qwen3.5 HD256 prefill call sites
  (single + batched, each with plan + run) converge on
  `ops::prefill_attention_paged_run_hd256`; the FlashInfer `plan_hd256`
  calls are cfg-gated since TileLang is plan-less. The
  `PagedPrefillBuffers35::plan` field stays under both cfg arms (allocated
  but unused under tilelang-attn — "不着急删除"). Pending-remote bench
  stub:
  `docs/experience/wins/2026-04-27-bench-guidellm-cuda-tilelang-prefill-hd256-pending-remote.md`
  (historical reference, file removed).

- **Tranche 3 (HD256 paged-decode swap) — landed 2026-04-27.** Wires the
  new TileLang HD256 paged-decode kernel
  (`crates/cuda-kernels/tools/tilelang/batch_decode_paged_hd256.py`,
  authored upstream of this tranche) into build.rs / FFI / Rust dispatch
  under the same `tilelang-attn` flag. AOT-specialized over the same
  Qwen3.5 full-attn head configs as Tranche 2: `(8,2)`, `(16,2)`,
  `(16,4)`. Default builds remain on FlashInfer
  `flashinfer_batch_decode_hd256_run`; `--features tilelang-attn` swaps
  in the TileLang path. The single Qwen3.5 BF16 HD256 decode call site
  (in `qwen35/batch_decode.rs`) gains the TileLang-only `batch_size` /
  `max_qlen` / `total_pages` scalars + a `qo_indptr_gpu` slice; the
  `metadata.plan_hd256(...)` call in `BatchDecodeBuffers35::plan_attention`
  is cfg-gated since TileLang is plan-less. FFI sym scoping is kept
  clean by giving decode its own `tilelang_decode_hd256_decl!` macro
  (identical fill rules to the prefill twin). Pending-remote bench
  stub:
  `docs/experience/wins/2026-04-27-bench-guidellm-cuda-tilelang-decode-hd256-pending-remote.md`
  (historical reference, file removed).

- **Tranche 5 (single-prefill HD128/HD256, contiguous-KV) — landed
  2026-04-27, Option A: contiguous-KV single-prefill paths deliberately
  stay on FlashInfer.** Reasoning: T0 verification confirmed these paths
  are unreachable from the OpenAI hot path
  (`prefill_uses_paged_pool() = true` for both Qwen3 and Qwen3.5; the
  paged pool is always active during server warmup). The remaining
  callers of `flashinfer_single_prefill` (HD128) and
  `flashinfer_single_prefill_hd256` (HD256) are
  `infer/src/speculative/cuda.rs` (offline speculative draft model in
  batch_serving), `infer/tests/bench_prefill.rs`,
  `infer/examples/regenerate_test_data.rs`, and
  `infer/src/bin/bench_serving.rs` — all offline / test / bench
  surfaces. TileLang's AOT cubins are paged-only (`page_size = 16` with
  `kv_indices` / `kv_indptr` indirection); contiguous-KV input is a flat
  `[seq_len, num_kv_heads, head_dim]` tensor with no paged pool to
  index. Synthesizing a "1-page virtual paged pool" wrapper at the call
  site would add runtime cost and a code path that no production caller
  benefits from. Keeping FlashInfer canonical here is consistent with
  the L4 evidence behind "全部接入" (which only covers paged-prefill
  HD128 / paged-prefill HD256 / paged-decode HD128/HD256 / TC decode)
  and with the project rule "不着急删除". **No code change** in this
  tranche — doc-only ledger entry so the next iteration of "全部接入"
  does not re-investigate. Decision recorded:
  `docs/experience/wins/2026-04-27-bench-guidellm-cuda-tilelang-single-prefill-hd128-hd256-pending-remote.md`
  (historical reference, file removed).

### Codex review pass (≥3 rounds, per user requirement)

Three independent `codex review --commit <sha>` rounds ran against the
chain. Outcomes:

- **Round 1 — T4 (`4b0e3f6`)**: clean. *"I did not find any discrete
  correctness issues introduced by commit 60c36ba in the reviewed
  diff."* (commit hash rebased to `4b0e3f6` while reviews ran; same
  diff content.)
- **Round 2 — T3 (`02d0333`)**: P2 finding caught and fixed. Codex
  flagged that `batch_decode_paged_hd256.py` `BLOCK_N=64 + NUM_STAGES=2`
  produces ~128 KB dynamic shared memory, exceeding sm_89 / L4's ~99 KB
  per-block cap — the cubin would not load on L4. Fix landed in
  `ae35aed` (halved BLOCK_N to 32 to mirror the prefill HD256 twin),
  bench-stub doc synced in `84fc783`.
- **Round 3 — T2 (`58aa008`)**: clean. *"No discrete, actionable
  correctness issues were found in the changes introduced by commit
  58aa008. The default FlashInfer path remains intact, and the TileLang
  HD256 path is consistently gated behind the opt-in feature."*

T5 (`a4e873c`) is doc-only and was not separately reviewed. The T3 fix
(`ae35aed`) is a single tile-constant change; trivial mechanical edit
not separately reviewed.
