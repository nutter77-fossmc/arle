# Task #35 Pass 3 cap=8 first-burst — formula prediction PRE-bench

> **Purpose**: codex is currently running W4 c=8 agent trace cold-start
> bench for Task #35 acceptance. Per SKILL kernel-optimization v1.12.0
> mantra rule 1 ("Predict with formula, not vibes"), Claude commits a
> prediction NOW (before numbers come back) so reality vs prediction
> can be reconciled in the wins entry. This is the SOLID
> license-or-kill discipline applied to a substrate change.

## §1 What Pass 3 does

Per `M_warmup-prefill-pass-directive.md` + codex Task #35 implementation:

- **Pass 1**: model load + weights pinning (always)
- **Pass 2**: graph-capture mode only — re-captures graphs with autotuned algorithms
- **Pass 3** (NEW): cap=8 prefill batch pre-warm at server startup
  - default-on with `INFER_PREFILL_WARMUP=0` opt-out (per `60f114f`
    matched-control discipline doc)
  - Eager warmup of cap=8 prefill kernels so first cap=8 burst doesn't
    hit cold codegen / capture / JIT paths
  - Observed startup cost: +282.7ms (per codex's sustained-load A/B
    summary this session)
  - Pass 3 body itself: 308ms stable

## §2 Baseline (prior cap=8 bench numbers)

Per `docs/experience/wins/2026-05-08-ttft-p99-cap8-fix-86pct-reduction.md`
(Task #31 closure, `bench_agent_trace.py agent-w4-tool-resume`):

| Metric | cap=4 (pre-#31) | cap=8 (#31 default-on) | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| TTFT p50 | 11768 ms | 5868 ms | −50% |
| TTFT p99 | 72515 ms | 10259 ms | −86% |
| p99/p50 spread | 6.2× | 1.75× | −72% |

The cap=8 numbers above are the **without-Pass-3 baseline** for Task
#35. Codex's Task #35 "off" arm should reproduce ~5868 / 10259 ms
(within σ).

## §3 Formula prediction for Pass 3 cap=8 first-burst

### §3.1 Mechanism

First cap=8 burst (request set 1, fresh server, cold kernels):

```
TTFT_first_burst = T_kernel_cold + T_graph_capture + T_prefill_compute
                 + T_decode_first_token

Without Pass 3:
- T_kernel_cold = full JIT/codegen on first cap=8 prefill = ~hundreds of ms
- T_graph_capture = cuda graph capture for cap=8 shape = ~tens of ms
- T_prefill_compute = warm-path baseline (~hundreds of ms for 8×512=4096 tokens)
- T_decode_first_token = warm-path baseline (~10 ms)

With Pass 3:
- T_kernel_cold = ~0 (paid at server startup via Pass 3 +282.7ms)
- T_graph_capture = ~0 (already captured during Pass 3)
- T_prefill_compute = warm-path baseline (unchanged)
- T_decode_first_token = warm-path baseline (unchanged)
```

### §3.2 Magnitudes

The current cap=8 baseline (5868 ms p50 / 10259 ms p99) IS the
"steady-state cap=8" — these numbers are aggregated over many bursts
in the agent trace, including warm ones. The cold first-burst is
amortized.

If Pass 3 eliminates the cold first-burst overhead:
- p50 over the trace: should change LITTLE (most bursts are warm
  already in steady-state)
- p99 (the first burst tail): could drop more visibly since first
  burst's tail is the worst case
- p99/p50 spread: should tighten further

### §3.3 Predicted Δ ranges

| Metric | Predicted Δ vs `off` arm | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| TTFT p50 | **−2% to +2%** (essentially noise) | Most agent-trace bursts are warm; first-burst small fraction |
| TTFT p99 | **−5% to −20%** | First-burst tail is what Pass 3 eliminates |
| TTFT p99/p50 spread | **−5% to −15%** | Tight tail = better spread |
| First-burst TTFT (if measured separately) | **−30% to −60%** | This is what Pass 3 actually optimizes |
| Steady-state ITL p50 | **0% (unchanged)** | Pass 3 doesn't touch decode |
| Server startup time | **+282.7ms** (observed, paid once) | Already measured |

### §3.4 License threshold (Claude's pre-bench gate)

Per SKILL v1.12.0 Phase 8 license-or-kill:

| Outcome | Verdict |
|---|---|
| TTFT p99 Δ > −10% AND first-burst Δ > −30% AND ITL Δ ≈ 0 | LICENSE Pass 3 default-on |
| TTFT p99 Δ < −5% (regression in tail) OR first-burst Δ > −10% | KILL Pass 3 (effect too small to justify +282.7ms startup) |
| Between | REVIEW (might want to flip default-on/off based on workload) |

## §4 What could falsify this prediction

Per skill #1 "推断 ≠ SOLID — 推断 = hypothesis, evidence = bench numbers":

1. **bench_agent_trace.py shape ≠ first-burst-heavy**: if the agent
   trace replays many warm bursts and only 1-2 cold first-bursts, the
   first-burst Δ would be diluted in aggregates. **Check codex's
   wins entry for first-N-burst breakdown.**
2. **Pass 3 doesn't actually warm the right kernels**: implementation
   bug — Pass 3 might warm shape A but production hits shape B.
   Symptom: no cold-vs-warm difference in numbers. **Check codex
   wins for whether off/on first-burst differs at all.**
3. **Cold first-burst on this shape is already small**: maybe the
   agent trace's first burst doesn't trigger expensive JIT (e.g. TileLang
   AOT cache hit). Symptom: Δ ≈ 0 across all metrics.
4. **Variance dominates**: σ across N=3 runs > Δ → not a real win.

## §5 Reconciliation plan

When codex's wins entry lands:

1. Read the actual TTFT p50 / p99 / first-burst Δ
2. Compare to §3.3 predicted ranges
3. If WITHIN range → SKILL #1 mantra holds, formula was right
4. If OUTSIDE range:
   - Above range (over-delivered) → revise formula upward, learn
     that JIT cost was bigger than estimated
   - Below range (under-delivered) → check §4 falsification list
5. Either way, document the actual Δ in this doc's §6 (added by next
   tick)

## §6 Actual results — reconciled vs codex wins entry

Source: `docs/experience/wins/2026-05-10-bench-35-cap8-prefill-warmup.md`
(codex-authored, untracked at this moment, content read this tick).

### §6.1 Sustained-load arms (codex measured n=3, σ < 5% all)

| Metric | Predicted Δ | Actual Δ | Within range? |
|---|---|---|---|
| TTFT p50 conc=1 | -2% to +2% | +0.6% (66.0 → 66.4 ms) | ✅ within |
| TTFT p50 conc=2 | -2% to +2% | +2.3% (79.0 → 80.8 ms) | ⚠ marginal (above) |
| TTFT p50 conc=4 | -2% to +2% | +0.3% (157.2 → 157.7 ms) | ✅ within |
| ITL p50 conc=1 | 0% | 0.0% (5.80 → 5.80 ms) | ✅ exact |
| ITL p50 conc=2 | 0% | 0.0% (7.44 → 7.44 ms) | ✅ exact |
| ITL p50 conc=4 | 0% | -3.4% (8.31 → 8.03 ms) | ✅ within (slight improvement) |
| Out tok/s conc=1 | ~0% | -0.1% (159.76 → 159.53) | ✅ noise |
| Out tok/s conc=4 | ~0% | +1.6% (423.82 → 430.58) | ✅ noise |
| Server startup overhead | +282.7 ms (observed) | **+282.7 ms exact** (1077.7 → 1360.3 mean) | ✅ exact match |
| Pass 3 body time | 308 ms (observed) | **308 ms** stable n=3 | ✅ exact match |

**Sustained-load verdict: all predictions held.** The +2.3% conc=2 TTFT
is marginally above the predicted ±2% band but within statistical noise
(CV = 3.85% baseline / 3.36% treatment, so the difference is < 1×σ).

### §6.2 First-burst arms — NOT measured

Per codex's wins entry §Problems:
- First W4 agent-trace attempt used `--model default` → 404 for every
  request (model name issue, codex caught + corrected)
- Corrected attempt was long-running rather than short smoke; codex
  stopped after `requests=127, active=8, kv_util=100%` to free GPU
- **Did not count as license data**

So the metric Pass 3 actually optimizes (first-burst TTFT, predicted
-30% to -60%) is **STILL UNMEASURED**. TTFT p99 (predicted -5% to -20%)
also not in the wins entry — sustained-load reports p50 only.

Codex's own §Rule confirms: "Startup warmup changes need two gates: a
short sustained-load regression smoke for conc 1/2/4, and a separate
full first-burst workload for the workload that originally exposed the
bimodal failure. Do not substitute one for the other." — **identical
to my §4.1 falsification concern.**

### §6.3 License-or-kill verdict per §3.4 threshold

| Gate | Status |
|---|---|
| TTFT p99 Δ > -10% | ❓ not measured |
| First-burst Δ > -30% | ❓ not measured (the actual gate metric) |
| ITL Δ ≈ 0 | ✅ confirmed (0% on conc=1/2, slight improvement conc=4) |

→ **REVIEW** (verdict deferred until first-burst metric measured).

Pass 3 is sustained-load-safe (regression-free) but the cap=8
first-burst optimization claim is unproven. Codex correctly refuses
to claim Task #35 acceptance based on sustained-load smoke alone.

### §6.4 Formula validity assessment

Per SKILL kernel-optimization v1.12.0 mantra rule 1 ("predict with
formula, not vibes"):

- **Sustained-load mechanism prediction**: ✅ formula correct.
  Pass 3 is per-server-startup; once warm, steady-state unaffected.
  All 3 concurrencies × 3 metrics (TTFT/ITL/tok-s) within or marginal
  to predicted ranges.
- **First-burst mechanism prediction**: ⏳ unverified. Falsification
  reason §4.4 ("variance dominates") doesn't apply since we have no
  measurement; falsification reason §4.1 ("bench shape ≠
  first-burst-heavy") explains why codex's chosen smoke shape (5-second
  warmup + 30-second sustained) doesn't expose the cold first burst.
- **Startup cost prediction**: ✅ exact match (codex's measured
  +282.7ms identical to the observation Claude based the prediction
  on).

**Net**: formula PARTIALLY validated. Sustained-load predictions
exact; first-burst predictions await the dedicated agent-trace bench
codex stopped for time.

### §6.5 Next steps

- Task #35 wins entry NOT closing the cap=8 first-burst gate by
  itself. Either:
  1. User runs the long-form `bench_agent_trace.py
     agent-w4-tool-resume` (the Task #31 8k W4 cap=8 burst shape,
     30+min) to measure first-burst TTFT
  2. Accept Pass 3 as "sustained-load-safe + +282.7ms startup, no
     first-burst measurement yet" — license on regression-guard alone,
     defer first-burst proof

### §6.6 CRITICAL CAVEAT — bench numbers came from BUGGY Pass 3

Per codex's tmux output 2026-05-10 ~46min, codex review caught **3
substantial bugs** in Task #35 diff (not 1 as 5f3f58f initially
claimed):

1. **sync() called twice** (mentioned earlier, codex review tick)
2. **Pass 3 needed to derive per-row token count from
   `chunked_prefill_size` / token budget** (was wrong, fix in flight)
3. **Pass 3 was warming graphs to a TEMPORARY context that gets
   dropped** — graph prefill resources were being warmed then thrown
   away. **This means Pass 3 was effectively a no-op for the
   graph-prefill case.**

Implication for reconciliation: the bench numbers above (§6.1) measured
"BUGGY Pass 3 (effectively no-op for graph case)" vs "Pass 3 disabled".
Both arms had ≈0 functional Pass 3, hence no improvement observed.

The post-fix bench (when codex commits + re-bench) should show:
- Sustained-load: still ~no improvement (mechanism prediction unchanged
  — Pass 3 doesn't help c=1/2/4 even when working)
- First-burst: NOW the actual prediction range (-30% to -60%) becomes
  testable. Pre-fix bench couldn't have distinguished prediction-true
  from no-op, since Pass 3 was no-op either way.

This **does NOT invalidate** the §6.1 sustained-load reconciliation
(predictions held within ±2.5% noise) but **DOES change the
interpretation**: it doesn't prove "Pass 3 sustained-load-safe" because
Pass 3 was effectively absent on the graph path. It proves "no-op Pass
3 sustained-load-safe" — a weaker claim.

**Re-bench needed after codex's fix lands** to validate Pass 3
sustained-load claim with functional Pass 3.

### §6.7 Updated SKILL #33 evidence count

Task #35 codex review caught **3 real bugs** (sync, chunked_prefill_size,
temporary-context), not 1. That brings the n=2 evidence to:

| Session | Diff | Formal gates PASS | Codex review caught |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ace3cbe` PF8.3 | 12 files | build+clippy+greedy+e2e | 3 real bugs |
| Task #35 (codex pending) | 6 files | build+clippy+greedy+sustained-load | **3 real bugs** |

Both diffs: substrate, all formal gates PASS, **codex review caught 3
bugs each**. Pattern is consistent magnitude, not just consistent
existence. Strong argument that codex review is the highest-yield
verification step for non-trivial diffs.

## §7 SKILL #33 reinforcement candidate (n=2 evidence)

Originally codified in `0be7220` v1.12.0 from PF8.3 substrate session
(`ace3cbe` codex review caught 3 bugs that build/clippy/greedy/e2e all
PASSED). Today's Task #35 reinforces:

| Session | Diff | Formal gates | codex review caught |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-10 PF8.3 (`ace3cbe`) | 12 files, +3936/-13 LOC | build+clippy+greedy+e2e PASS | 3 real bugs (parallel-M loop, max_par/lock workspace, graph-capture interaction) |
| 2026-05-10 Task #35 (codex pending commit) | 6 files, ~?LOC | build+clippy+greedy+sustained-load PASS | sync() double-call (1 real bug) |

Both diffs were "non-trivial substrate" by SKILL #33's criteria
(≥3 files / FFI boundaries / cross-feature interactions). Both had
all formal gates PASS. Both had codex review catch real bugs that
would have slipped to production.

This is **n=2 evidence** for SKILL #33 — sufficient to upgrade from
"recently codified anti-pattern" to "battle-tested canonical
practice". No revision needed; the rule is reinforced, not refined.
