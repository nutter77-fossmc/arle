# Bench — M_e.13 SSD KV persistence: functional, but no TTFT win on canonical workload — 2026-05-08

## Goal

Validate the existing-in-tree SSD KV persistence path
(`MetalQwen35PrefixRuntime::persist_snapshot` / `try_import_disk_prefix` /
`reconcile_disk_entries`) by comparing cold (fresh disk dir) vs warm
(server restart with persisted snapshot) end-to-end latency on a
deterministic c=1 workload. Hypothesis: warm phase TTFT/E2E should drop
substantially because the 2784-token block-aligned prefix is restored
from disk instead of re-prefilled.

## Hypothesis

- **Functional**: cold phase persists snapshot to `--kv-disk-dir`; warm
  phase's `reconcile_disk_entries` re-indexes it; same-prompt warm
  request triggers `try_import_disk_prefix` with matched_len > 0 →
  `session_affinity_hit` increments by 1.
- **Perf**: warm E2E time should drop 60-80% (full 2795-token prefill
  ≈ 15s → 2784-token attach + 11 residual prefill ≈ 1-3s + decode).

## Command

```bash
# bench driver: /tmp/m_e13_bench_v2.sh
# - cold phase: rm -rf /tmp/arle_kv_disk_m_e13_v2; metal_serve --kv-disk-dir /tmp/arle_kv_disk_m_e13_v2
#   send long-prompt (~2795 tokens) request; capture e2e time + /v1/stats
# - warm phase: same metal_serve flags (re-uses persisted snapshot)
#   send IDENTICAL request; capture e2e time + /v1/stats
```

Long deterministic prompt: 25× repeated paragraph (~2795 tokens) +
short user query. `temperature=0.0`, `max_tokens=16`, `stream=false`,
`session_id="m_e13_v2_session"`. Server restarts cleanly between
phases.

## Environment

- **Backend**: Metal (Apple Silicon) — Apple M4 Pro
- **MLX**: 0.31.1, **macOS**: 26.3.1
- **Model**: `mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit`
- **Commit**: `1f270eb9` (post-M_e.12)
- **Feature set**: `cargo build --release --no-default-features
  --features metal -p infer --bin metal_serve`
- **Auto-wired-limit**: 20 GiB pinned (default-on)
- **--kv-disk-dir**: `/tmp/arle_kv_disk_m_e13_v2` (fresh in cold,
  populated in warm)
- **--max-running-requests**: 1

## Results

| Phase | E2E request time | prompt_tokens | session_affinity hit Δ | session_affinity miss Δ | Disk index entries |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cold (fresh dir) | **15.343s** | 2795 | 0 | **+1** | 0 → after-request 1 (122068137 bytes / 122 MB) |
| Warm (persisted snapshot) | **16.509s** | 2795 | **+1** | 0 | 1 entry indexed at startup (`reconcile_disk_entries`) |

```
Cold phase server log:
2026-05-08T11:57:39.464  INFO Metal Qwen3.5 SSD prefix cache indexed 0 entries (0 bytes)

Warm phase server log:
2026-05-08T11:58:17.450  INFO Metal Qwen3.5 SSD prefix cache indexed 1 entries (122068137 bytes)
```

**Functional path: ✓ confirmed.** `session_affinity_hit Δ+1` in warm
phase + `122 MB` of persisted KV bytes re-indexed at startup is direct
evidence that `try_import_disk_prefix` ran and matched.

**Perf hypothesis: ✗ falsified.** Warm E2E (16.509s) is 7.6% SLOWER
than cold (15.343s), not the predicted 60-80% faster.

## Δ vs hypothesis

| Aspect | Predicted | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| `session_affinity_hit` Δ in warm phase | +1 | +1 ✓ |
| Disk index re-loaded on restart | yes | yes ✓ (1 entry, 122 MB) |
| Warm E2E vs cold | -60% to -80% | **+7.6%** (NOT a win) |

## Problems / observations

1. **Import path executes but TTFT doesn't drop.** Three plausible
   explanations to investigate next tick (in priority order):
   - (a) **The import-attach is happening but the underlying C++
     `step_session` path runs full prefill anyway** — i.e.,
     `state.driver.import_prefix_snapshot(snapshot)` (request_state.rs:1704)
     loads KV bytes into memory but the next `prefill_step` call doesn't
     short-circuit and instead re-runs forward through every layer. This
     would be a silent implementation bug. **High suspicion.**
   - (b) **122 MB disk read + Rust deserialize + MLX array binding
     is comparable to a fresh 2784-token prefill on M4 Pro.** Fresh
     prefill at ~186 tok/s = 2784/186 ≈ 15s; 122 MB at 3 GB/s NVMe
     ≈ 0.04s + decode/bind overhead. Doesn't explain 16.5s alone unless
     the deserialize path is bincode-style serial. **Medium suspicion.**
   - (c) **Block alignment trims more than expected.** snapshot stores
     `floor(N/16)*16` = 2784 of 2795 tokens; remaining 11 still need
     prefill = ~60ms. Trivial — doesn't explain gap. **Low suspicion.**
2. **session_affinity_hit semantics confirmed**: from `metrics.rs:203-208`,
   it increments whenever `matched_prefix_tokens > 0`. Both in-memory
   and disk attach paths flow through this point. Δ+1 is a true positive
   for "the import attempted and matched something".
3. **Block-alignment guard at `request_state.rs:1698`** (`matched_len >=
   state.prompt_tokens.len()` returns `Ok(false)`). For an EXACT same-
   prompt cold/warm pair, the snapshot is block-aligned to 2784 tokens
   while prompt is 2795 — so 2784 < 2795 and import proceeds. Confirmed
   not a false-rejection case here.

## What worked

- **Direct `/v1/stats` JSON before/after diff** caught the
  session_affinity counter increment cleanly (no scraping, no log
  parsing). This is the right signal for "did the import-attach path
  actually run?". The metric was already present (didn't need to add a
  probe).
- **`stream=false` + Python-timed end-to-end curl** gave reliable E2E
  numbers; the v1 streaming `head -1` approach grabbed HTTP headers
  not first-token, returning ~85ms which was meaningless.
- **`ignore_eos:true` ... wait, not used here.** v2 used `temperature=0.0`
  + identical body bytes, which guaranteed identical token_ids without
  needing ignore_eos. Simpler.

## Rule

When a path that "should" deliver a perf win has its on-path metric
firing correctly but no measurable wall-clock improvement, **do not
ship a wins entry claiming the perf delta**. The functional confirm
(metric Δ) and perf falsification (E2E unchanged) together are a
net-zero bench, not a win — record honestly and file the next-tick
investigation.

## Next

- **Investigate hypothesis (a)**: trace `state.driver.import_prefix_snapshot`
  → C++ `step_session` interaction. Does the next `prefill_step` skip
  forward or re-run? Add a probe at the C++ entry that logs
  "imported_prefix_active=true; skipping forward layers 0..N". If probe
  shows imported state IS used but full forward STILL runs, that's
  the bug.
- **Investigate hypothesis (b)**: time the disk-read + deserialize
  alone (independent of prefill) by a microbench that loads the
  snapshot from disk and discards. If 1-3s, that's the budget.
- **`--kv-disk-dir` default-on decision**: hold until perf gap is
  resolved. Default-off remains correct for now — the path stores
  122 MB per session but doesn't deliver a TTFT win.
- **eli M_e.10 patch** still local-only at /Users/bytedance/code/eli/
  — awaiting user push authorization.
