# ARLE Support Matrix

This document is the canonical support-status truth for `ARLE`.

It states what the repository currently supports, what is still limited, and
what validation exists for each area. If something is not listed as supported
here, do not assume it is supported just because it compiled locally.

State reflected here is based on repository evidence as of 2026-05-10.
Project framing lives in [index.md §Current Positioning](index.md#current-positioning).

## 1. Runtime Backends

| Backend | Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CUDA | Supported | Primary serving path. Main runtime, scheduler, and benchmark focus. |
| Metal | Beta | Usable for local validation and live scheduler-backed serving. Qwen3.5 ships live prefix reuse via replayed compiled-path snapshots; `scripts/start_metal_serve.sh` is the canonical first-time Apple bring-up path. Qwen3.5-0.8B MLX 4bit single-request step-driver is measured at 305.5 tok/s on M4 Pro 20c for `1024/256`. The matched GGUF Q4_K_M exact default is 202.1 tok/s direct; the opt-in native-q4 load path reaches 236.7 tok/s direct / 239.8 tok/s step-driver and remains a separate exact packed-K-quant kernel/format gap. Metal is still missing full batched-decode parity with CUDA, especially on variable-length Qwen3.5 decode. |
| Metal DFlash | Beta | Apple Silicon speculative decode path. Default-on for Qwen3.5; benchmark before production use. |
| no-cuda / CPU-only | Development-oriented CPU backend | Build, test, and smoke-validation path for non-GPU logic. Not a production inference target. |

---

## 2. Platform Matrix

| Platform | Backend | Status | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux x86_64 + NVIDIA GPU | CUDA | Supported | Release workflow builds CUDA artifacts; primary target. |
| macOS Apple Silicon | Metal | Beta | CI checks and tests Metal/no-cuda surfaces. |
| Linux/macOS without GPU | no-cuda | Development-oriented CPU backend | Unit tests, compile checks, and CPU backend smoke validation. |

### CUDA GPU / SM Matrix

Tier policy and rationale: see [`plans/sm-coverage.md`](plans/sm-coverage.md).
Env var contract: see [`environment.md`](environment.md) §`TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST`.

| Tier | SM | Representative GPUs | Status | Default-built |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T1 | sm_80 | A100 40/80GB | Supported | yes |
| T1 | sm_86 | A10, RTX 3090, A40, A6000 | Supported | yes |
| T1 | sm_89 | L4, RTX 4090, L40 | Supported | yes |
| T1 | sm_90 | H100, H200 | Supported | yes |
| T2 | sm_100 | B100, B200 | Beta — opt-in via `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` | no |
| T2 | sm_120 | RTX 5090, RTX PRO 6000 | Beta — opt-in via `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` | no |
| T3 | sm < 80 | V100, T4, Pascal, older | Unsupported — build rejects | n/a |

Notes:

- Hosted CI does not provide full CUDA runtime correctness coverage.
- CUDA correctness and performance still require dedicated GPU validation.
- T1 ship gate requires four-card bench validation (sm_80 + sm_86 + sm_89 + sm_90); see [`plans/sm-coverage.md`](plans/sm-coverage.md) §5.

## 3. Model Family Matrix

| Model family | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Qwen3.5 | Supported | Primary supported family. Supported on normal runtime paths; Metal live runtime has a narrow same-length decode batch path with packed-batch concurrent decode (2026-04-16 fix). Qwen3.5-0.8B has two measured Metal single-request paths: MLX SafeTensors 4bit step-driver reaches 305.5 tok/s for `1024/256`, while GGUF Q4_K_M exact default is 202.1 tok/s direct and its opt-in native-q4 load path reaches 236.7 tok/s direct / 239.8 tok/s step-driver on the same `1024/256` profile. RoPE scaling (YARN / Linear / NtkAware) wired through `Qwen35Config::rope_scaling` for long-ctx extend (Phase 1+2 closed; Phase 3 bench pending). Metal DFlash is Beta; see §4a for the current validation note. |
| Qwen3.6 / Qwen3.5-MoE | Beta (Metal), CUDA stub | Metal loads and runs `mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit` locally. A 2026-04-27 M4 Pro short diagnostic confirmed load/execute behavior, but DFlash performance decisions for this family should use long-context / ultra-long-sequence workloads only. CUDA intentionally returns a GPU-required stub for Qwen3.6 MoE. Full Qwen 3.6 serving coverage is the **#2 next-model priority** — see roadmap note below. |
| DeepSeek V4 | In progress — V4-only substrate + CPU reference smoke | `crates/deepseek-spec` is V4-only for the local `infer/models/dsv4-mini-1B-init` checkpoint. `cpu_serve` has a slow Rust reference path that mmaps the 2.0 GB safetensors and runs a 1-token HTTP completion smoke; `arle train pretrain-dsv4` seeds from the same V4 1B init checkpoint and rejects old nano/V3 SKUs. CUDA optimized V4 attention/MoE/MTP kernels remain pending, so this is not a serving-performance target yet. **#1 next-model priority.** |
| Llama 3/4 | Planned | Not yet supported. |
| DeepSeek-V3/R1 | Not carried | Deleted from the current registry/spec/train surface; reintroduction would require a new explicit project, not a compatibility branch inside DSv4. |
| Mistral / Mixtral / Gemma / Phi | Planned | Not yet supported. |

**Next-model roadmap priority** (canonical in [`ROADMAP.md` §Next-Model Priority Order](../ROADMAP.md#next-model-priority-order)):

1. **DeepSeek V4 (DS4)** — V4-only substrate and CPU reference smoke landed; CUDA V4 hybrid attention + MoE + MTP kernels are the active runtime blockers.
2. **Qwen 3.6** — planned / scoping; CUDA serving and kernel coverage land after the DS4 runtime substrate is producing benches. Metal load path already exists for diagnostic use.

Other "Planned" families above sit behind these two and are not actively scheduled.

## 4. Quantization Matrix

| Capability | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FP8 KV cache | Beta | FP8 E4M3 + fused-dequant decode attention; 50% KV memory reduction, benchmarked. |
| INT8 KV cache | Beta | INT8 W8A16 GEMV/GEMM + INT8 KV fused-dequant decode; benchmarked. |
| TurboQuant KV (2–4 bit) | Experimental | Fused decode attention with dequant. Fast-moving optimization area. |
| W8 / W4 / W2 weight quantization | Beta | Native W4 GEMV path + Marlin W4 prefill (5–25× TTFT on long prompts). |
| W4-hybrid prefill CUDA Graph capture | Opt-in (CUDA) — **Tier 1 wins** | `INFER_PREFILL_GRAPH=1` + `INFER_HYBRID_W4A8_PREFILL=1` enables prefill-lifetime `MarlinPrefillScratch` lifecycle + multi-key 8-d graph cache + bucketed allocation key for Qwen3.5 paged prefill on W4 / W4-hybrid. Phase 1 functional gate PASS (`35fc3cf`); Path A multi-key throughput KILLED (`e462c53`); Path B device-memory `start_pos` v1 KILLED (`a7a8b94`); **Path B.2 bucketing fix DELIVERS Tier 1 wins** (`a56b7a9`/`c44788f`): engine TTFT p50 2000ms → 150ms = -92.5%, 7 unique capture keys (98.5% LRU reuse), +632% throughput on matched-control 4k/c=4 60s window — closes the +76.6% SGLang gap on this workload. Default behavior unchanged when env vars unset. Client-side guidellm 0.6.0 TTFT measurement broken with graph capture (`e8d82b0` — bench tool bug, not substrate); use server-side `/v1/stats engine_ttft_us` for ground truth. |
| GPTQ / AWQ (W4A16) | Beta | GEMV + Marlin kernel path; format detection production-ready. |
| GGUF loading | Beta | Supported loader path. CUDA ships the native packed Q4_K GPU kernel (`q4k_gemv_kernel` + packed fast path in `crates/cuda-kernels/csrc/gemm/quantized_gemv.cu`) — fits Carnice-27B on L4-24GB. Metal supports Qwen3.5 GGUF on Apple Silicon via the shared Rust GGUF parser; Qwen3.5-0.8B Q4_K_M defaults to exact GGUF affine/packed behavior. Set `AGENT_INFER_METAL_GGUF_NATIVE_Q4=all` for an opt-in lossy load-time conversion into MLX native q4 group64 for packed Q3/Q4/Q5/Q6/Q8 tensors. It is still slower than MLX SafeTensors 4bit, so exact K-quant Metal kernels remain a separate optimization target. |

Backend note:

- The `FP8 KV cache`, `INT8 KV cache`, and `TurboQuant KV` rows above describe
  the shipped project-wide quantized-KV work, which is currently CUDA-backed.
- Metal / MLX does **not** currently ship quantized KV cache. The live Metal
  path stores KV in the model's native dtype today, typically `bf16` / `f16`,
  and it does not expose a `--kv-cache-dtype` surface.
- Metal can still run weight-quantized MLX models; that is separate from
  quantized KV cache support.

## 4b. Multi-turn KV Reuse / Tiered KV Matrix

The KV-reuse architecture that the README calls out (slot-sticky multi-turn
reuse + radix-backed `T0 GPU → T1 host pinned → T2 NVMe → T3 cluster-shared`).
Code lives in `infer/src/prefix_cache.rs` (radix tree) and
`infer/src/kv_tier/` (tiered-KV plumbing); see
[`docs/codebase-map.md`](codebase-map.md) for the per-file map.

| Capability | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Slot-sticky multi-turn KV reuse | Supported (CUDA), Beta (Metal) | Prior-turn KV stays in slot for the next turn so only new user tokens prefill. CUDA is the primary path; Metal Qwen3.5 ships live prefix reuse via replayed compiled-path snapshots (see §1). |
| Radix-backed prefix cache (T0 GPU) | Supported (CUDA) | Direct GPU-page attach + tail-page CoW on shared prefixes; `RadixNode` carries `hit_count`, `tier_location`, `session_id`, `fingerprint`, `soft_pin_until`, `byte_len`. |
| T1 host-pinned spillover | Beta (CUDA) | Cold blocks demote from GPU to host pinned memory via `HostPinnedPool` (`kv-native-sys` arena); promote-on-use through `ReadmissionPlan`. |
| T2 NVMe local-disk transport | Beta (CUDA) | Node-local persistence via `kv_tier/transport/disk.rs` on top of `crates/kv-native-sys` (file/block ABI, mmap, WAL). |
| T3 cluster-shared backend | Experimental | Minimal `transport/shared_fs.rs` reference backend ships; **NIXL transport remains stub-only** (`nixl-sys` activates the stub feature, no real link). Treat T3 as scaffolding, not a production tier today. |

---

## 4a. Speculative Decoding Matrix

| Capability | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Metal DFlash (Qwen3.5) | Beta | End-to-end correctness landed 2026-04-17 (commits `4db4fe9`, `439293d`); benchmark before production use. |
| Metal DFlash (Qwen3.6 / Qwen3.5-MoE) | Beta / diagnostic | Target/draft pairing is wired for `mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit` + `z-lab/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-DFlash`. Short checks are smoke diagnostics only; future DFlash optimization claims must come from long-context / ultra-long-sequence runs. |
| CUDA speculative decoding | Not shipped | CUDA plumbing exists (`infer/src/speculative.rs`, `infer/src/speculative/cuda.rs`, `infer/src/scheduler/cuda/spec_path.rs`) for external/self verifier experiments, but no CUDA spec-decode mode is shipped as throughput-positive. Classical/self/external paths are killed or regressed; Qwen3.5 Medusa is blocked on recurrent-state accepted-length rollback. See [`plans/2026-05-01-longctx-spec-decode-phase2.md`](plans/2026-05-01-longctx-spec-decode-phase2.md) and [`plans/M_medusa-phase1b-qwen35-v2-snapshot-ring-redesign.md`](plans/M_medusa-phase1b-qwen35-v2-snapshot-ring-redesign.md). |

## 5. Public API Matrix

| Surface | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/v1/completions` | Stable | Documented public API. |
| `/v1/chat/completions` | Stable | Documented public API. |
| `/v1/models` | Stable | Loaded-model discovery endpoint. |
| `/v1/responses` | Beta | Non-streaming and SSE forms shipped. Streaming emits `response.created`, `response.output_text.delta`, and terminal `response.completed`; structured outputs are still missing. |
| SSE streaming | Stable at high level | Intended to remain OpenAI-style; edge behavior may improve. |
| `/metrics` | Stable | Prometheus endpoint; Metal now reports live queue / latency / MLX memory gauges. |
| `/v1/stats` | Stable | Human-readable stats endpoint; Metal now reports live queue / latency / MLX memory gauges. |
| Train-side `/v1/train/status|events|stop|save` via `pretrain --serve`, `train_sft --serve`, `train_grpo --serve`, `train_multi_turn --serve` | Beta | Current control-plane truth lives in `crates/train`. Shared control-plane wiring is live on all four binaries, and CUDA has now been validated on all four active train surfaces. `train_grpo` and `train_multi_turn` were both exercised on CUDA for live `/v1/train/{status,events,save,stop}` control-plane behavior on 2026-04-21. `infer` can now expose the same surface as an optional proxy via `--train-control-url`, while the train-side server remains the sole authority. |
| Metal runtime memory knobs | Beta | `metal_request`, `metal_bench`, and `metal_serve` expose `--memory-limit-bytes`, `--cache-limit-bytes`, and `--wired-limit-bytes` for MLX allocator control. |
| CLI agent slash commands | Beta | Usable and documented, but not yet treated like the HTTP API for compatibility. |
| `arle serve` front door | Beta | Launches the matching serving binary (`infer`, `metal_serve`, or `cpu_serve`) from the release artifact or PATH. This is a packaging/DX front door over existing server binaries, not a second HTTP implementation. |
| CLI built-in shell/python tools | Beta | Enabled by default for local trusted agent use. `--no-tools` disables them, and `arle --doctor` reports the detected sandbox backend (`nsjail`, `sandbox-exec`, or `bare`). Do not expose tool-enabled local agent prompts to untrusted users. |
| Structured-output grammar (xgrammar FFI) | Scaffold (Phase 1) | `crates/xgrammar-sys` Rust safe wrapper over upstream `mlc-ai/xgrammar` v0.1.34 (codex's #26 WIP, FFI substrate landed; default build = stub, `--features real` builds C++ shim via `cc` + pinned upstream checkout). No HTTP, scheduler, sampler, or GPU sampling integration yet. Tracked under [`docs/plans/M_xgrammar-ffi-scaffold.md`](plans/M_xgrammar-ffi-scaffold.md). |

## 5a. Training Surface Matrix

| Surface | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
> All training surfaces are reached through `arle train ...` / `arle data ...`. The standalone `pretrain` / `train_sft` / `train_grpo` / `train_multi_turn` / `eval_lm` / `download_dataset` / `convert_dataset` binaries that previously shipped from `crates/train` are no longer produced; their dispatch logic is included in-process from `crates/cli/src/train_cli.rs`.

| `arle train pretrain` | Supported | Canonical scratch-pretrain surface for the current Qwen-family train stack. HF-style checkpoint dirs + `latest` marker + exact optimizer-state resume. CUDA save/eval/resume was validated on L4 on 2026-04-21. Hybrid Qwen3.5 scratch-pretrain is accepted locally on CPU + Metal via `arle train pretrain --linear-attn-every 2 -> arle train eval` using the same checkpoint layout. |
| `arle train sft` | Supported | Qwen3.5 family dispatch, LoRA-only fine-tune surface, adapter-aware checkpointing and resume. Mac-local Metal validation covers the dense/full-attn Qwen3.5 path (`train pretrain -> train sft --backend metal -> train eval -> resume`, LoRA rank=8, Apple M4 Pro, 2026-04-21). Hybrid linear-attn Qwen3.5 LoRA fine-tune is also validated on CPU + Metal for tiny synthetic checkpoints on 2026-04-21; CUDA compile surface is checked, but CUDA runtime acceptance for the hybrid path is not yet closed. |
| `arle train grpo` | Supported | Single-turn RL surface with exact checkpoint/resume, shared observability/control-plane wiring, and backend selection across `cpu|metal|cuda`. CUDA was validated on 2026-04-21 for `train grpo -> checkpoint/latest -> train eval -> resume` plus live `/v1/train/{status,events,save,stop}` control-plane behavior on the synthetic dense Qwen3.5 path. Hybrid linear-attn Qwen3.5 end-to-end acceptance is closed locally on CPU + Metal for `arle train grpo --linear-attn-every 2` including checkpoint materialization; CUDA compile surface is checked, but CUDA hybrid runtime acceptance is still pending. |
| `arle train multi-turn` | Supported | Backend flag supports `cpu|metal|cuda`. CUDA was validated on 2026-04-21 for stepwise GRPO, sequence-level GSPO, exact resume, `/v1/train/{status,events,save,stop}` control-plane endpoints, and checkpoint reload through `arle train eval` on the dense/full-attn path. Hybrid linear-attn Qwen3.5 end-to-end acceptance is closed locally on CPU + Metal: stepwise-GRPO and sequence-level-GSPO both run against hybrid configs and save checkpoints; CUDA compile surface is checked, but CUDA hybrid runtime acceptance is still pending. |
| `arle train eval` | Supported | Loss / perplexity evaluation for Qwen3.5 checkpoint dirs on tokenized or chat JSONL. Hybrid linear-attn Qwen3.5 checkpoint evaluation is validated on CPU + Metal on 2026-04-21. |
| Hybrid linear-attn Qwen3.5 LoRA/eval path | Supported | `Qwen35Model` supports hybrid linear-attn layers for LoRA/frozen-eval use. Acceptance is closed for `arle train sft` + `arle train eval` on CPU + Metal using tiny synthetic checkpoints, and the CUDA compile surface is checked. |
| Hybrid linear-attn Qwen3.5 scratch pretrain / RL acceptance | Supported on validated CPU + Metal path | Hybrid scratch pretrain runs through `arle train pretrain --linear-attn-every > 0`, `arle train eval` reloads the resulting checkpoints, `arle train grpo` accepts hybrid configs end-to-end on CPU + Metal, and `arle train multi-turn` has end-to-end hybrid acceptance for both stepwise-GRPO and sequence-level-GSPO across CPU + Metal. CUDA compile surface is checked; CUDA runtime acceptance for the hybrid path remains pending. |
| Infer-side unified `/v1/train/*` bridge | Supported (optional proxy) | `infer` exposes `/v1/train/status|events|stop|save` when `--train-control-url http://...` is configured, forwarding to the train-side server in `crates/train/src/server.rs` without duplicating trainer logic. Live proxying was validated on 2026-04-21 with `arle train pretrain --serve` behind `cpu_serve --train-control-url`. |
